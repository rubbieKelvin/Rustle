# YAML file for testing queue generation logic

# Define some dummy environment variables (not directly used by queue generation, but needed for schema)
env:
  base_url:
    default: "http://example.com"

# Define requests with different dependency structures
requests:
  # Request with no dependencies
  RequestA:
    method: GET
    url: "{{base_url}}/a"

  # Request with a single dependency
  RequestB:
    method: GET
    url: "{{base_url}}/b"
    config:
      depends_on: [RequestA]

  # Request with multiple dependencies
  RequestC:
    method: GET
    url: "{{base_url}}/c"
    config:
      depends_on: [RequestA, RequestB] # Depends on A and B

  # Request that depends on a request that has dependencies
  RequestD:
    method: GET
    url: "{{base_url}}/d"
    config:
      depends_on: [RequestC] # Depends on C, which depends on A and B

  # Request that is a dependency for multiple other requests
  RequestE:
    method: GET
    url: "{{base_url}}/e"

  # Requests that depend on RequestE
  RequestF:
    method: GET
    url: "{{base_url}}/f"
    config:
      depends_on: [RequestE]

  RequestG:
    method: GET
    url: "{{base_url}}/g"
    config:
      depends_on: [RequestE] # Also depends on E

# Define sequences to test sequence processing
calls:
  # Simple sequence of individual requests
  simple_seq:
    - RequestA
    - RequestB
    - RequestC

  # Sequence including a request with dependencies
  seq_with_deps:
    - RequestD # Should pull in C, B, and A due to dependencies

  # Sequence with repeated requests (should be de-duplicated)
  seq_with_duplicates:
    - RequestA
    - RequestB
    - RequestA

  # Sequence calling another sequence
  nested_seq_inner:
    - RequestE
    - RequestF # Depends on RequestE

  nested_seq_outer:
    - /nested_seq_inner # Calls the inner sequence
    - RequestG # Depends on RequestE (already in inner_seq's dependencies)
    - RequestA # Also in simple_seq

  # Sequence combining different types of entries
  mixed_seq:
    - RequestA
    - /simple_seq # Calls simple_seq
    - RequestD # Request with dependencies
    - RequestE
    - /nested_seq_inner # Calls nested_seq_inner
